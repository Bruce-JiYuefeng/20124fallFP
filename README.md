# Backend and Frontend Workspaces

**Note:** Frontend and backend are now completely separate for better organization. Follow the setup instructions below to get started.

---

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
1. **Ensure Node.js is Installed**:
   - Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the `frontend/code` directory:
     ```
     cd frontend/code
     ```
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Run the following commands in the terminal:
     ```
     npm install
     npm install lottie-react
     ```

---

### 2. Start the Frontend Development Server
1. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the server by running:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
2. **Access the Application**:
   - Follow the link displayed in the terminal output to view the frontend application in your browser. The default URL should look like:
     ```
     http://localhost:(your Vite port, default is 5173)
     ```

---

### 3. Prerequisites for Full Functionality
1. **Backend Connection**:
   - Ensure the backend server is running before interacting with backend-dependent features.
   - Refer to the **Backend Setup** section for instructions on setting up and running the backend.

2. **Verify Compatibility**:
   - Use a browser like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox for the best experience.

## Backend Setup

### 1. Download Apache Maven
- Download Apache Maven 3.9.9 from the official website: [Maven Downloads](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Download Tomcat 10.1 from the official website: [Tomcat10.1 Downloads](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi#10.1.34)

---

### 2. Import the Backend Project
1. **Clean the `backend` folder**:
   - Delete all files in the `backend` folder except `README.md`.
2. **Import the project**:
   - import zip file into the `./backend/` directory through eclipse.
3. **Resolve `pom.xml` errors**:
   - If there are errors in the `pom.xml` file, go to:
     - `Preferences` â†’ `Maven`
     - Select all **DOWNLOAD** options.
4. **Note on Dependencies**:
   - Dependencies such as `gson` and `sql connector` are now managed via the `pom.xml` file.
   - For backup purposes, these files are also available in:
     ```
     \20124fallFP\config\environment
4. **Note on Tomcat**:
   - Require Tomcat 10.1
   - Dependencies json files `gson` and `sql connector` need to be copied and pasted to your tomcat place:
     ```
     path to tomcat/tomcat/lib
     ```

---

### 3. Deploy the Backend Code
1. **Generate the '.war' file**:
   - run the command
     ```
     mvn clean build
     ```
     in the project folder, you will get a `.war` file in target folder.
2. **Deploy the `.war` file**:
   - Copy the `.war` file to:
     ```
     Tomcat/webapps/
     ```
   - Start the server and access the web application at:
     ```
     http://localhost:(your tomcat port, default should be 8080)/20124fallFP
     ```
3. ** *Optional*: You can also try right-clicking the project in Eclipse IDE and selecting **Run on Tomcat** (**much faster and easier**).**

## Setup-MySQL
### Download Instructions
Download and install MySQL server community 8.0 (or later) and MySQL Workbench 8.0 (or later)<br />

### Configuration options
*Everything is mostly default, leave as-is<br />
Legacy authentication<br />
Server port 3306<br />
Use "root" for both user and password<br />

### Creating the database
Open MySQL workbench<br />
Open the db.sql file<br />
Run/execute the file<br />

## Database Design
### Datatypes
Used DATETIME over TIMESTAMP because TIMESTAMP only allows up to dates in 2038. 2038 problem<br />
DATETIME format is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
Used DECIMAL over FLOAT/DOUBLE for exact precision<br />
See [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/data-types.html) for details<br />
