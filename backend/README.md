This is the workspace for backend.

If you just clone the repo. please clean up this folder except README.md and then import the project from repo/release to here. 
To set up: download maven, get tomcat ready, paste two json files into the tomcat/lib.

You should be able to see the default page when you run project on the tomcat.
note: the version of tomcat is Tomcat10.1

Once you run the project and the page pops up, you should be able to use the page you opened in the frontend now.
