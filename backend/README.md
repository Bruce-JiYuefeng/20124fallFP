This is the workspace for backend.

If you just clone the repo. please clean up this folder except README.md and then import the project from repo/release to here. 
To set up: download maven, get tomcat ready, paste two json files into the tomcat/lib.

You should be able to see the default page when you run project on the tomcat.
note: the version of tomcat is Tomcat10.1

when you navigate to the link to login page it should show 405 error. It is what it should be.

Once you run the project, the page pops up. You should be able to use the page you opened in the frontend now.
